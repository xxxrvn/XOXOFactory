This Plugin has a lot of functions, you can use the WidthPathDrawable to draw Bezier Curves and Spirals,
and WidthPathCollision for Collisions of Bezier Curves and Spirals and Curve2Ds, dont forget to click on click to update, if you made any changes.
You can also use Curve2Ds in WidthPathDrawables, but this look ugly but yolo.
In the ShaderHandler you can add custom effects, the inter effects, are for the interpolation, the combi effects are for the combinations of the colors, and the after effects, can change the colors.
Click on create custom in an effect, to get an custom code effect out of it, the codes are in glsl, with arguments like :v0:, and the variable : x : etc. are specific for gradient and type of effect.
Dont forget to change the shader id, if you let the shader id field be free, it generates an unique id for you.
